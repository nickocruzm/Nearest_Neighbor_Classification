# Nearest Neighbor Classifier

## Overview

Designed and implemented Nearest-Neighbor Classifier in Python. Using two greedy feature search algorithms to optimize classifier's accuracy. Accuracy computed using k-fold cross validation.

## Datasets

Datasets are read formatted as .txt files, found in the datasets folder. Two test datasets are provided:

  - Small_dataset.txt, [100x10]
      - 100 Instansces
      - 10 Features
  - Large_dataset.txt [1000x100]
      - 1000 Instances
      - 100 Features
